## Contribution

The easiest way to help the project is to sort channels by country. Specifically for this was created playlist `channels/unsorted.m3u` which contains channels that are not yet sorted by other playlists. If you recognize one of the channels in this playlist, just copy its title and link to the desired country playlist. That's it!

If you want to add new channel to the playlist you need add link to stream and some information about it. For example:

```xml
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="exampletv.us" tvg-name="Example TV" tvg-logo="http://example.com/channel-logo.png" group-title="News",Example TV
http://example.com/stream.m3u8
```

| Attribute   | Description
| ----------- | ---
| tvg-id      | Channel ID that is used to load EPG (optional)
| tvg-name    | Channel name (optional)
| tvg-logo    | The logo of the channel (optional)
| group-title | One of the following categories: Auto, Business, Classic, Comedy, Documentary, Education, Entertainment, Family, Fashion, Food, General, Health, History, Hobby, Kids, Legislative, Lifestyle, Local, Movies, Music, News, Quiz, Religious, Sci-Fi, Shop, Sport, Travel, Weather.
